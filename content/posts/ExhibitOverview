### About This Exhibit 

Teeming with natural disasters, domestic and international social tensions, these past few months hardly left us with a mental break.

As a student organization founded amidst the pandemic, we hope to provide a safe space for all to share their perspectives and to document the different experiences in this special time, from the US and beyond. 

We have collected **more than 120 artworks of various mediums - sketches, painting, photography, animation, design, documentary, short movies, music - from 62 artists, representing 16 countries.** 

We hope that, by going through this exhibition, you could feel relaxed and find resonance. 


### Collaboration with non-profits 
 
This ongoing pandemic has not been easy for all of us, so we want to support the vulnerable ones in our community. We have partnered up with three non-profit organizations helping the ill/abused children through art, **Kids & Art Foundation**, **Free Art**, and **Children's Cancer Research Fund**. You could find their information respectively by clicking on the posts with their names on the first page of the exhibit. On the first page, you will also find a Children Artwork section, where we showcased art pieces created collaboratively by children fighting cancer with an artist volunteer. 

### Acknowledgement

We thank everyone who has helped us to make this exhibition possible.
