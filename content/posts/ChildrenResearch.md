## About Us
“We believe a world without childhood cancer is possible – but it’s going to take all of us.” --- Children’s Cancer Research Fund 

Children’s Cancer Research Fund supports the brightest scientists whose ideas make the greatest impact for children with cancer. We work closely with researchers to fund innovative new projects quickly so that their promising new discoveries can continue uninterrupted. Our researchers share their findings with more than 9,000 experts around the globe, collaborating with others to accelerate discoveries. Because childhood cancer affects the whole family and community, we also fund quality of life services that enhance healing and care. 
There are many ways for you to get involved such as a volunteer and fundraiser. Learn more at childrenscancer.org .
