## About Us
Free Arts uses art to restore hope, resilience and self-esteem in children in Los Angeles ages 5-18 who have experienced abuse, poverty, neglect and/or homelessness. The mission, values, and purpose of Free Arts focus on uplifting those most impacted by injustice and inequity in our community. We remain steadfast in this work while continually examining what more we can do, to not only provide services, but to dismantle the structures and systems that stand in the way of equality, inclusion, and opportunity for every single member of society. We depend on our team of committed volunteers to make this possible. 

## Ways you can help 
Although we are still experiencing the struggles of COVID-19 and our in-person programs are currently paused, we still have remote volunteer opportunities available. Our Free Arts Mentorship Program is designed to use the creative arts to foster life skills, self-confidence, and resilience. Each week participants create art and engage in dialogue, covering topics such as communication, identity, and family. This program takes place over Zoom with our partner agencies located throughout Los Angeles County. Volunteers serve as mentors for the children and facilitate a variety of art workshops online with the help of other volunteers and the Free Arts team. Our other remote volunteer opportunities include helping us prepare materials/pack art kits for the youth attending the mentorship program, and becoming a part of the Free Arts coloring sheet/worksheet design team! 

We also offer our Teaching Artist program driven for those who are already working in the arts professionally, who want to volunteer and share their skills with the youth we serve.

If you are interested in working with us, please reach out to our Program Operations Coordinator, Jocelyn Garcia, by emailing her at jocelyn@freearts.org. For more information or if you would like to donate to our cause, check us out at freearts.org.
