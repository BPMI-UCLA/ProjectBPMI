## About Author

**Artist Name:** Jose Simonovis 

### Introduction 
I was born in Venezuela in 1993 and completed my studies in Architecture and Design at the University of Los Andes, ULA. During my architecture career, I discovered an important interest in Arts, especially Visual Arts. So I started to explore myself in conceptual photography. As a consequence I also started to post and express my thoughts and feelings about my personal living situations or global situations like in this case that we all are put in one, in a pandemic. I moved to Buenos Aires and I was there for 2 years for meeting the city, work, knowing culture and people.

## About Artwork
In this transforming time, we have learnt to be more creative and flexible, also we have realized that the only staircase for getting up is each of us. 

The second photo is named 'Light And Clean Hands For Flying With Them." Faced from an uncertain scenery about the things that we don't know about coming, the minimum thing that we can do is to have our hands light and clean.
