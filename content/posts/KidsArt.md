## About Us
The Kids & Art Foundation’s mission is to be a catalyst for healing in the lives of pediatric families touched by cancer and all life threatening illnesses by enhancing their quality of life through the inclusion of creative arts, wellness and whole child supportive programs.

Our programs are designed to reduce the child and caregiver’s stress and anxiety, facilitate peer socialization, and promote typical physical development. Kids & Art is here to support the child’s function, psychosocial well being, communication, and expression so that they can be stronger in their fight.  

## Ways you can help 
There are many ways you can enhance the mission of Kids & Art. You can volunteer as an artist, photographer, blogger, and workshop & fundraising volunteer. Through volunteers’ help, we hope to bring art to any child regardless of the health battles they're fighting. Demonstrate passion and commitment.  If you like to use art to help uplift the spirits of pediatric patient families, here is the individual volunteer information page for you: individual volunteer . Please note that due to COVID-19, we do not have any in-person workshops. The best way to volunteer right now is through our People-2-Purpose campaign which will enable us to send ArtKits to our pediatric patients who are seeing longer and more isolated stays in the hospital. If you believe that #ArtHeals then join the campaign as an individual or join one of our teams, please check our legacy fundraiser page.

Kids & Art wants to spread the healing effects of art across the United States and the world. If you are interested in being an ambassador and advocate for healing through art - for any group of people, and for any reason - please reach out to us! We have a vision for art clubs across university, high school, and medical campuses across the United States and abroad. If you want to help with that movement, please contact us at partnerships@kidsandart.org.
