## Mission
Kids & Art Foundation’s mission is to improve the quality of pediatric cancer care by focusing on the whole child in treatment by including healing through arts in their protocol. We seek to improve well-being during treatment, as survivors, and in bereavement. We hold various art workshops for healing, to empower, encourage, and create memorable experiences.

## Ways you can help 
There are many ways you can help in the Kids & Art Foundation. You can volunteer as an artist, photographer, blogger and workshop & fundraising volunteers. Through volunteers’ help, we hope to make an artist out of a child regardless of the battles they're fighting in their real lives. Demonstrate passion and commitment.  If you like to use art help us uplift the spirits of families in pediatric cancer treatment, here is the individual volunteer information page for you: individual volunteer

We hold a Fundraising right now. Our programs are designed to reduce the child and caregiver’s stress and anxiety, facilitate peer socialization, and promote typical physical development. Kids & Art is here to support the child’s function, psychosocial well being, communication, and expression so that they can be stronger in their fight.  
If you like to help in a fundraising way, please check our Fundraise page.
